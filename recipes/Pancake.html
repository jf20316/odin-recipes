    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>A fluffy and delicious snack perfect for breakfast.This easy pancake recipe is made with a handful of simple ingredients and results in pancakes that are light and fluffy, moist, and infused with cinnamon and vanilla. Cooked on a griddle in salted butter, they are truly the best pancakes you will ever eat!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salted butter</li>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Whole milk</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by preheating an electric griddle to 350 degrees F or heat a nonstick fry pan, cast iron skillet, etc. over medium heat on the stove.</li>
        <li>Then, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sea salt and cinnamon, in a large bowl and set it aside to use later.</li>
        <li>Next, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Then, add the eggs, sour cream and vanilla and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is smooth, whisk in the milk.</li>
        <li>Next, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth.</li>
        <li>If desired, you can add mix-ins at this phase of the recipe (try these chocolate chip pancakes, they're delish). I suggest chocolate chips, dried fruit, nuts, etc.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter onto the preheated griddle and spread it out with a spatula to ensure it's evenly distributed over the surface.</li>
        <li>Then, pour batter in Â¼ cup portions onto the pre-heated, buttered griddle. Cook on the first side for about 2-3 minutes or until the middle begins to bubble and the sides look set.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook for 1-2 more minutes until the second side is browned and the pancakes puff slightly. Repeat until all the batter has been used, melting fresh butter onto the griddle with each new batch of pancakes.</li>
        <li>If you'd like to keep pancakes warm in between batches, preheat your oven to 200 degrees F. As the pancakes come off the griddle, transfer them to a large baking sheet and put them in the oven to stay warm. </li>
        <li>Serve these fluffy pancakes warm with a dollop of butter and a glug of maple syrup.</li>
