    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>It is not actually the dish but the process of preparing it. It hailed from the Visayan region and is derived from the word, kilaw, which means raw or uncooked. The meat, normally a fish, is 'cooked' without the application of heat but is rather cured in vinegar.</p>
